//	Using //export in a file places a restriction on the preamble: since it is copied into two different
//	C output files, it must not contain any definitions, only declarations. If a file contains both definitions
//	and declarations, then the two output files will produce duplicate symbols and the linker will fail. To avoid
//	this, definitions must be placed in preambles in other files, or in C source files.
